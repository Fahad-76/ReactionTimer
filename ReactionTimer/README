The Reaction Time Tester game allows two players to test their reaction time by testing their
accuracy in stopping at the right number. The speed of which the numbers cycle depends on the
difficulty they pick at the Difficulty_Pick state. Each game has 6 rounds where player 1 and player 2
take turns in trying to stop the counter at the displayed number. The points in each player is then
tallied and the player with the most points win. If both players have the same points, then it is a tie.
